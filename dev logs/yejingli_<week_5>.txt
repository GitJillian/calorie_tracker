determine user/admin behaviors and write code for these two classes
Add more functions to Food class
Along with other memebers, using Andriod Studio to write front-end code for self-selected mode

For code structure:
add management level controller to encapsulate the privacy of class properties
e.g a student cannot access administrator's menu unless the admin have send it to management level
