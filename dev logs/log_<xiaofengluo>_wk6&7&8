Week 6 &7 &8
This weeek what I have done:
1) Working on D3 documents and diagrams
2) Working on log out and edit user profile functions with Yejing Li

The challenge I faced:
1. To learn how to kill activities to avoid users going back to the last layout when pressing onBack button
2. To learn how edit JSON file but failed, so for the edit profile function is actullay deleting the old user JSON file and create a new one.
