During these three weeks
I have to work on the Develiverable2 and 3
Since last dev vlog said that I was prepared for the D2
and What I did for during the D2 is preparing the database set. insert all the food's calorie information to the database
and also working on the UI interface, cause UI is connected to each part of coding so it spends some time to communicate with teammates

its quit challenge to me that figure out how to use android studio and toolbar, it's quite hard to learn and spend some time to watch the tutorial for that
