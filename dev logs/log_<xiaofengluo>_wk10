Week 10
This weeek what I have done:
1) Working on D4 Document together
2) Fixing small problem in Report mode including showing averaging calories and displaying users' BMR.

The challenge I faced:
1. It is not easy to do overall testing by using own data espcially when I don't have an android phone. 
2. To be very careful in the testing and to find anything that we can improve in the last few days.
